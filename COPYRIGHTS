For code originating from OpenSSL:

 * - usr/lib/ica_s390_stdll/rsa_sup_mul.c: Copied from OpenSSL from 
 *   crypto/bn/rsa_sup_mul.c and modified to fit to the OpenCrptoki environment.
 *   See comment in usr/lib/ica_s390_stdll/rsa_sup_mul.c for a list of changes.
 *   Note that in OpenSSL the file crypto/bn/rsa_sup_mul.c does no longer
 *   exist, it was removed with commit https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4209ce68d8fe8b1506494efa03d378d05baf9ff8
 * - usr/lib/common/constant_time.h: Copied unchanged from OpenSSL from
 *   include/internal/constant_time.h
 * - The implementation of function rsa_parse_block_type_2() in 
 *   usr/lib/common/mech_rsa.c is copied from OpenSSL's function
 *   ossl_rsa_padding_check_PKCS1_type_2() in crypto/rsa/rsa_pk1.c
 *   and is slightly modified to fit to the OpenCryptoki environment.
 *   See comment in function rsa_parse_block_type_2() for a list of changes.
 * - The implementation of function openssl_specific_rsa_derive_kdk() in
 *   usr/lib/common/mech_openssl.c is copied from OpenSSL's function
 *   derive_kdk() in crypto/rsa/rsa_ossl.c and is slightly modified to fit to 
 *   the OpenCryptoki environment. See comment in function 
 *   openssl_specific_rsa_derive_kdk() for a list of changes.
 * - The implementation of function openssl_specific_rsa_prf() in
 *   usr/lib/common/mech_openssl.c is copied from OpenSSL's function
 *   ossl_rsa_prf() in crypto/rsa/rsapk1.c and is slightly modified to fit to 
 *   the OpenCryptoki environment. See comment in function 
 *   openssl_specific_rsa_prf() for a list of changes.
 * - The implementation of function decode_eme_oaep() in
 *   usr/lib/common/mech_rsa.c is copied from OpenSSL's function
 *   RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_OAEP_mgf1() in crypto/rsa/rsa_oaep.c and is
 *   slightly modified to fit to the OpenCryptoki environment. See comment in
 *   function decode_eme_oaep() for a list of changes.
