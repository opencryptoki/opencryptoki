  CKM_AES_MAC, and CKM_AES_MAC_GENERAL mechanisms.
- Some code cleanup in pkcsslotd.
- pkcsslotd daemon uses a socket rather than shared memory to pass
  slot information to the opencryptoki library.
- New testcases added for various crypto algorithms and pkcs#11 api calls.
- Add README to docs directory for how to setup ICSF token.

  for ICA token.
- Allow import of RSA public and private keys into CCA token.
- Systemd support added.
- Various bugfixes and additional testcases.

* opencryptoki-2.4.2 (April 27, 2012)
- Re-factored spinlocks, such that each token has its own spinlock
  in its own directory relative to /var/locks/opencryptoki.

* opencryptoki-2.4.1 (February 21, 2012)
- SHA256 support added for CCA token
- Several crypto algorithm testcases refactored to include published
  test vectors. 
- Testcase directory restructured for future improvements.
- Allow tpm stdll to get SRK passwd and mode from new env variables.
  See [1] for info on how to use this feature and please report any bugs.

  some cleanup of unused locking schemes.
- Various bugfixes and cleanup.

* opencryptoki-2.4 
- Support for Elliptic Curve Support in CCA token.
- Support for AES CTR in ICA token.
- Session handling refactored from using a reference to memory to
  using a handle that references a binray tree node.
- Cleanup logging. Debug messages now go to a file referenced in 
  OPENCRYPTOKI_DEBUG_FILE env variable.
- Various bugfixes and cleanup.

* opencryptoki-2.3.3 (Jan 13 2011)
- Moderate fixes and clean-ups to key unwrapping mechanisms
- several pkcsconf fixes, some minor changes
- Important fix to CCA library name in pkcs11_startup

- Huge testsuite refactor
- Several other minor fixes and cleanups

* opencryptoki-2.3.2 (Jul 29 2010)
- Significant clean-ups to the building and packaging systems and many
  small fixes by Klaus Heinrich Kiwi <klausk@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
- Various minor fixes to slot daemon and init script by Dan Horák
  <dan@danny.cz>
- Some RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding clean-ups by Ramon de Carvalho Valle
  <rcvalle@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
- Human-readable flags output to pkcsconf, some minor soft-token
  fixes by Kent Yoder <key@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
- Improved overall session/object look-up performance. Note that this
  change might crash buggy callers with badly-written session/object
  handle tracking - Klaus Heinrich Kiwi <klausk@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

* openCryptoki-2.3.1
- Moved ICA token to use libica-2.0, supporting newer hardware and 4K
  RSA modulus. Libica-2.x is now *required* to build the ICA token.
- Moved CCA token to use CCA-4.0, supporting AES, SHA-2 and 4K RSA
  keys in newer hardware. Although not required for building, CCA-4.0
  is *required* for running the CCA token.

* openCryptoki-2.2.5

- Added code to set the encryption and signature schemes of keys imported
into the TPM token.
- Added tpm token message to warn when only owner can read the pub SRK.
- Fixed return code of function failed when it should be buffer too small in
various mech_des.c mech_des3.c and mech_aes.c files.
- Moved doc/*.txt to manpage format and integrated them into the build/install
- Updated testcases to query env vars for PINs and call a set of common
routines for common operations
- Added SHA256 support for all tokens
- Fixed object cleanup when max number of token objects is hit
- Fixed fd exhaustion bug with spin lock fd
- Updated TPM stdll for TSS policy handling changes. Trousers 0.2.9+ now
