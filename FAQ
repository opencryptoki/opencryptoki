 1. Q. All openCryptoki applications are returning CKR_TOKEN_NOT_PRESENT,
    even though the token is there, and its STDLL is in the right place.
    What's the problem?

    A1. The user who's executing the application is probably not a member
    of the pkcs11 group.

    A2. Check that the device driver for your hardware token is loaded.
    (`lsmod` in Linux).

    A3. If you're doing development, this error will also be returned of your
    token's STDLL has unresolved symbols in it.  Enable debugging and
    check the debug log to find out what symbols are undefined.

 2. Q. When C_Initialize() gets called by my app, openCryptoki returns
    CKR_HOST_MEMORY, even though I've got lots of free memory.  What's
    the problem?

    A1. CKR_HOST_MEMORY is returned also if openCryptoki cannot attach
    to shared memory.  This can happen if:

	a1. The user who's executing the application is not a member of
	the pkcs11 group.

	a2. pkcsslotd is not running.

 3. Q. pkcsconf is returning:

    Error getting token info: 0x2
	This is CKR_HOST_MEMORY, see question 2.

    Error getting token info: 0x3
	The slot ID you're providing is invalid.

 4. Q. How can I get the complete debug logs from openCryptoki?

    A. In opencryptoki version 3.3, tracing was introduced. Trace
       messages are enabled via the environment variable, 
       OPENCRYPTOKI_TRACE_LEVEL=<level>. Set this environment variable to 
       one of several trace levels available:
	1 - log error messages
	2 - log warning messages
	3 - log informational messages
	4 - log development debug messages; these messages may help debug
	    while developing pkcs#11 applications.
	5 - debug messages that are useful to opencryptoki developers;
	    this level must be enabled via --enable-debug option in the
	    configure script.

	Note: Trace messages increase as the trace level increases.
	In other words, trace level 4 includes all the messages from 
	trace levels 1, 2 and 3. 

       Prior to opencryptoki version 3.3, opencryptoki had to be compiled
       with debugging enabled, i.e configure --enable-debug. Debug messages
       were then logged to the file specified with the 
       OPENCRYPTOKI_DEBUG_FILE environment variable. If the environment
       variable was not set, then opencryptoki debug messages were not logged.
       Debugging does not have to be enabled for syslog messages to be
       logged.  Syslog messages are logged according to the system's syslog
       configuration.

       For versions of openCryptoki starting with openCryptoki-2.0 and before
       openCryptoki-2.4, define the environment variable PKCS11_API_LOG_DEBUG=1
       (in versions of openCryptoki before 2.0, define
       AIX_PKCS11_API_LOG_DEBUG=1).

       Also, apparently by default syslogd does not have an entry in
       /etc/syslogd.conf for debug messages, so even if you have debug
       messages enabled in your openCryptoki compile, you'll not get them in
       the system log until you edit /etc/syslogd.conf and restart syslogd.
       Add an entry in /etc/syslogd.conf such as:

	# vi /etc/syslogd.conf
	---
	[...]

	*.debug				/var/log/debuglog
	---
	# killall -HUP syslogd

        Now, when openCryptoki is configured with the --enable-debug
        option (or if you install the -debug rpms), /var/log/debuglog
        will receive its debugging messages.
