.SH NAME
pkcsslotd - shared memory manager for opencryptoki

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpkcsslotd\fP daemon manages PKCS#11 objects between
PKCS#11-enabled applications. When 2 or more processes are accessing
the same cryptographic token, the daemon is notified and updates
each application when the token's objects change.

.SH NOTES
Only one instance of the pkcsslotd daemon should be running on any
given host. If a prior instance of pkcsslotd did not shut down
cleanly, then it may leave an allocated shared memory segment on
the system. The allocated memory segment can be identified by its
key and can be safely removed once the daemon is stopped with the
ipcrm command, such as:

\fIipcrm -M 0x6202AB38\fP

The daemon creates the shared memory segment with group ownership by the
\fIpkcs11\fP group. All non-root users that should be able to use
openCryptoki need to be members of the group. Only trusted users should be
assigned to the group, see the "SECURITY NOTE" in the \fBopencryptoki\fP(7)
manual page for details.
