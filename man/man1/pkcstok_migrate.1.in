.SH NAME
pkcstok_migrate \- utility to migrate an ICA, CCA, Soft, or EP11 token repository
to the FIPS compliant format introduced with openCryptoki 3.12.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpkcstok_migrate\fP [\fB-h\fP]

\fBpkcstok_migrate\fP \fB--slotid\fP \fIslot-number\fP \fB--datastore\fP \fIdatastore\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert all objects inside a token repository to the new format introduced with
version 3.12.  All encrypted data inside the new format is stored using FIPS
compliant methods. The new format affects the token's master key files (MK_SO
and MK_USER), the NVTOK.DAT, and the token object files in the TOK_OBJ folder.

While using this tool no process using the token to be migrated must be running.
Especially the pkcsslotd must be stopped before running this tool.

The tool creates a backup of the token repository to be migrated, and performs
all migration actions on this backup, leaving the original repository folder
completely untouched. The backup folder is located in the same directory as the
original repository and is suffixed with _PKCSTOK_MIGRATE_TMP.

After a successful migration, the original repository is renamed with a suffix
of _BAK and the backup folder is renamed to the original repository name, so
that the migrated repository can immediately be used. The old folder may be
deleted by the user manually later.

After a successful migration, the tool adds parameter 'tokversion = 3.12' to the
token's slot configuration in the opencryptoki.conf file. The original config
file is still available as opencryptoki.conf_BAK and may be removed by the user
manually.

After an unsuccessful migration, the original repository is still available
unchanged.
