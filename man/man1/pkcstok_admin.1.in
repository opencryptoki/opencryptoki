.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The \fBpkcstok_admin\fP utility can be used to administrate token directories of
the Opencryptoki token repository with proper permissions and owners.
By default token directories are owned by the \fB@pkcs_group@\fP group, and
every user that is a member of the \fB@pkcs_group@\fP group has access to the
token and its token objects (i.e. keys, certificates, etc.).
.PP
A token directory can alternatively be owned by a token specific group.
Specify the group name with keyword \fBusergroup\fP in the slot definition in
the \fBopencryptoki.conf\fP configuration file located in
\fB@sysconfdir@/opencryptoki/\fP.
With that, only users that are members of the configured token specific group
have access to the token and its token objects. Users that are only members of
the \fB@pkcs_group@\fP group, but are not also members of the token specific
group do not have access to the token. Users of the token specific group must
still also be members of the \fB@pkcs_group@\fP group to be able to use
Opencryptoki.
.PP
Token specific files are usually stored in
\fB@localstatedir@/lib/opencryptoki/<token-name>/\fP. Additionally token
specific lock files are stored in
\fB@localstatedir@/lock/opencryptoki/<token-name>/\fP.
Furthermore, a token specific POSIX shared memory segment exists under
\fB/dev/shm/\fP. All files and directories within these token specific
directories as well as the shared memory segment are owned by the token
specific group, or by the \fB@pkcs_group@\fP group if no token specific group
has been configured.
.PP
The \fBpkcstok_admin\fP utility must be run as \fBroot\fP, and the
\fBpkcsslotd\fP must be stopped before running this utility.
.PP
.PP
.B Note:
Do not use the \fBpkcstok_admin\fP utility on a \fBTPM token\fP. The
\fBTPM token\fP uses a different directory structure, and stores token objects
on a per user basis. The \fBpkcstok_admin\fP utility is not capable of setting
the owners correctly on such a directory structure. Furthermore, the
\fBTPM token\fP is deprecated, because it supports only TPM version 1.2.
It does not work with TPM version 2.0.

.SH COMMANDS
.
The \fBpkcstok_admin\fP tool supports various commands to administrate token
directories.
.PP
.SS "Creating a new token and its directories"
.B pkcstok_admin
.B create
.BR \-\-token | \-t
.I TOKNAME
.RB [ \-\-group | \-g
.IR GROUP ]
.RB [ \-\-force ]
.RB [ \-\-verbose ]
.PP
Use the \fBcreate\fP command to create a new token and its directories.
.PP
Use the
.BR \-\-token | \-t
.I TOKNAME
option to specify the name of the token to create. The token name must also be
specified in the slot definition in the \fBopencryptoki.conf\fP configuration
file located in \fB@sysconfdir@/opencryptoki/\fP with keyword \fBtokname\fP.
.PP
Use the
.RB [ \-\-group | \-g
.IR GROUP ]
option to specify the token specific user group used as group owner of the
token directories. If no group is specified, the token directories will be owned
by the \fB@pkcs_group@\fP group. If a group is specified, then it must also be
specified in the slot definition in the \fBopencryptoki.conf\fP configuration
file located in \fB@sysconfdir@/opencryptoki/\fP with keyword \fBusergroup\fP.
.PP
The \fBpkcstok_admin\fP tool prompts for a confirmation before the token
directories are created. To omit the prompt, specify the
.B \-\-force
option. Use this option with care!
.PP
Specify the
.B \-\-verbose
option to see more detailed messages about the actions the tool is performing.

.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP 8
.BR \-\-token | \-t\~\fITOKNAME\fP
Specifies the name of the token to operate on. The token name must also be
specified in the slot definition in the \fBopencryptoki.conf\fP configuration
file located in \fB@sysconfdir@/opencryptoki/\fP with keyword \fBtokname\fP.
If the slot definition does not specify a \fBtokname\fP keyword, then a
default token name is used, dependent on the token model. The \fBICA token\fP
uses \fBlite\fP as default token name, the \fBCCA token\fP uses \fBccatok\fP,
the \fBSoft token\fP uses \fBswtok\fP, the \fBEP11 token\fP uses \fBep11tok\fP,
the \fBICSF token\fP uses \fBicsf\fP, and the \fBTPM token\fP (deprecated) uses
\fBtpm\fP.

file located in \fB@sysconfdir@/opencryptoki/\fP with keyword \fBusergroup\fP.

.SH "FILES"
.
.SS "@localstatedir@/lib/opencryptoki/<token-name>/"
Contains the token specific data, like the token's master key encrypted with
the SO and USER PINs (\fBMK_SO\fP and \fBMK_USER\fP), as well as the non
volatile token state data (\fBNVTOK.DAT\fP). Subdirectory \fBTOK_OBJ\fP
contains the token objects and an index file (\fBOBJ.IDX\fP).
.
.SS "@localstatedir@/lock/opencryptoki/<token-name>/"
Contains a token specific lock file (\fBLCK..<tokname>\fP) that is used to
synchronize access to the token data across multiple processes.

.SS "Token specific POSIX shared memory segment under /dev/shm/"
Contains token specific shared state data for tracking updates to token objects
done by processes. Its name is derived from the token specific directory
under \fB@localstatedir@/lib/opencryptoki/\fP.
