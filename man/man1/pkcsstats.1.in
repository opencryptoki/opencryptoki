pkcsstats \- utility to display mechanism usage statistics for openCryptoki.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays mechanism usage statistics for openCryptoki. Usage statistics are
collected by openCryptoki on a per user basis. For each user, mechanism
usage is counted per configured slot and mechanism. For each mechanism a set of
counters exist, one for each cryptographic strength of the cryptographic
key used with the mechanism.
.PP
The available strengths are defined in the strength configuration file
\fB/etc/opencryptoki/strength.conf\fP. Supported strengths are 112, 128, 192,
and 256 representing the corresponding strength in bits.
The strength configuration file defines how the strength is determined for the
various key types. A strength of zero is used to count those mechanisms that
do not use a key, or where the key strength is less than 112 bits.
.PP
.B Note:
The strength does not specify the cryptographic strength of the mechanism, but
the cryptographic strength of the key used with the mechanism (if any).
For example, usage of mechanism CKM\_SHA256 is reported under strength 0,
because no key is used with this mechanism. However, usage of mechanism
CKM\_AES\_CBC is reported under strength 128, 192, or 256, dependent on the
cryptographic size of the AES key used with it (and the definitions in the
strength configuration file).
.PP
Statistics collection is enabled by default. It can be disabled and configured
in the openCryptoki configuration file
\fB/etc/opencryptoki/opencryptoki.conf\fP.
By default only explicit mechanism usage statistics from PKCS#11 applications
are collected.
.PP
Optionally, implicit mechanism usage statistics can be collected, where
additional mechanisms are specified in mechanism parameters. For example,
RSA\-PSS or RSA\-OAEP allows to specify a hash mechanism and a mask generation
function (MGF) in the mechanism parameter. ECDH allows to specify a key
derivation function (KDF) in the mechanism parameter. The PBKDF2 mechanism
allows to specify a pseudo random function (PRF) in the mechanism parameter.
.PP
Also optionally, opencryptoki\-internal mechanism usage statistics can be
collected. This collects usage statistics for crypto operations used internally
for pin handling and encryption of private token objects in the data store.
.PP
.B Note:
Implicit or internal mechanism usage can not be distinguished from explicit
mechanism usage of PKCS#11 applications in the displayed statistics.
.PP
Statistics are collected in a POSIX shared memory segment per user. This shared
memory segment contains all counters for all configured slots, mechanisms, and
strengths. The shared memory segments are named
\fBvar.lib.opencryptoki_stats_<uid>\fP, where \fBuid\fP is the numeric user\-id
of the user the statistics belong to. The shared memory segments are
automatically created for a user on the first attempt to collect statistics
(when not already existent). The shared memory segments can be deleted using
the \fBpkcsstats\fP command with the \fB\-\-delete\fP, or \fB\-\-delete\-all\fP
options.
.PP
The usage of a mechanism is counted once when the cryptographic operation is
sucessfully initialized, i.e. during \fBC_DigestInit\fP, \fBC_EncryptInit\fP,
\fBC_DecryptInit\fP, \fBC_SignInit\fP, \fBC_SignRecoverInit\fP, and
\fBC_VerifyInit\fP. Multi-part operations involving the update functions like
\fBC_DigestUpdate\fP, \fBC_EncryptUpdate\fP, \fBC_DecryptUpdate\fP,
\fBC_SignUpdate\fP, and \fBC_VerifyUpdate\fP, are not counted additionally.
.PP
Other operations such as key generation, key derivation, key wrapping and
unwrapping are counted during the respective functions like \fBC_GenerateKey\fP,
\fBC_GenerateKeyPair\fP, \fBC_DeriveKey\fP, \fBC_DeriveKey\fP,
\fBC_UnwrapKey\fP.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
.BR \-U ", " \-\-user\~\fIuser\-id\fP
Specifies the user\-id of the user to display, reset, or delete statistics for.
If this option is omitted, the statistics of the current user are displayed,
resetted, or deleted. Only the \fBroot\fP user can display, reset, or delete
statistics of other users.
.TP
.BR \-S ", " \-\-summary
Shows the accumulated statistics from all users. Only the \fBroot\fP user can
display the accumulated statistics from other users.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " \-\-all
Shows the statistics from all users. Only the \fBroot\fP user can display
statistics from all users.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-all\-mechs
Shows the statistics for all mechanisms, also those with all\-zero counters.
If this option is omitted, only those mechanisms are displayed where at least
one counter is non\-zero.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-slot\~\fIslot\-id\fP
Specifies the slot\-id to display statistics for. If this option is omitted,
the statistics for all configured slots are displayed.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reset
Resets the statistics counters for the current user, or for the user specified
with the \fB\-\-user\fP option. Only the \fBroot\fP user can reset the
statistics from other users.
.TP
.BR \-R ", " \-\-reset\-all
Resets the statistics counters for all users. Only the \fBroot\fP user
can reset the statistics from other users.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-delete
Deletes the shared memory segment containing the statistics counters for the
current user, or for the user specified with the \fB\-\-user\fP option.
Only the \fBroot\fP user can delete the statistics from other users.
.TP
.BR \-D ", " \-\-delete\-all
Deletes the shared memory segment containing the statistics counters for all
users. Only the \fBroot\fP user can delete the statistics from other users.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Displays help text and exits.
