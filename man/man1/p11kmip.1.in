.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBp11kmip\fP tool can be used to transfer target keys between a PKCS\~#11
key repository and a KMIP server. Target keys may be imported or exported, and
are wrapped using public-key cryptography during transit. Keys used for
wrapping may also be sent and received. Only AES keys are supported as
target keys, and only RSA is supported for key wrapping.
.PP
.SS KMIP CLIENT AUTHENTICATION
KMIP authenticates the users with the client certificate exchanged during TLS
handshake. Thus, the client must generate a private RSA or EC key and a client
certificate. The client certificate must be registered with the KMIP server.
This is a KMIP server product-specific out-of-band process, which is not
described here. The client certificate can be a self-signed certificate or a
CA-signed certificate. In a production environment, use a CA-signed certificate.
.PP
The client private key identifies the client to the KMIP server, and thus
must be kept secret. If the client private key gets stolen by an attacker
then the attacker can identify itself at the KMIP server and thus gets access
to the keys stored in the KMIP server.
.PP
.SS USING A CLEAR CLIENT KEY
You can generate the client private key with OpenSSL command line tools. In
this case, the private key is a clear key stored in a PEM file.
For security reasons, store the client private key in a password-protected
PEM file. See an example on how to create a password-protected client key and
a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL commands:
.PP
\fB
    openssl genpkey \-algorithm RSA \-pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048         \\
                    \-out '/path_to_client_key/client.key' \-pass stdin    \\
                    \-aes\-256\-cbc
\fP
.PP
If you want to generate an EC key instead, use \fB\-algorithm EC\fP and
\fB\-pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:<curve-name>\fP. Create a self-signed certificate
with the just generated client key as follows:
.PP
\fB
    openssl req \-x509 \-key '/path_to_client_key/client.key'              \\
                \-out '/path_to_client_certificate/selfsigned_client.crt' \\
                \-nodes \-days 3650                                        \\
                \-subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US'
\fP
.PP
When using a password-protected client key PEM file, then you are prompted
for the PEM password. You are also prompted for further information for the
certificate to create, unless these details are supplied via the OpenSSL config
file. Refer to the man page of the \fBopenssl req\fP command for further
details.
.PP
If you want to generate a CA-signed certificate instead, omit the \fB\-x509\fP
option. Thus, the command generates a certificate signing request instead, that
you pass to the CA. With this request, you let the CA sign the certificate and
issue a CA-signed certificate for you.
.PP
.SS USING AN HSM-PROTECTED CLIENT KEY
A more secure way to protect the client private key is to generate and store the
client key inside a PKCS#11 token. If a secure key token, such as a CCA or
EP11 token, is used then the client private key is HSM protected and can not be
stolen. This requires the use of a PKCS#11 OpenSSL provider (with OpenSSL 3.0.0
or later), that is, the \fBpkcs11\-provider\fP from 
\fBhttps://github.com/latchset/pkcs11\-provider\fP. The PKCS#11 provider must
be installed and configured properly to allow access to openCryptoki. Use an
OpenSSL configuration file similar to the following:
.PP
\fB
    [openssl_init]
    providers = provider_sect

    [provider_sect]
    default = default_sect
    pkcs11 = pkcs11_sect

    [default_sect]
    activate = 1

    [pkcs11_sect]
    pkcs11\-module\-path = /path/to/libopencryptoki.so 
    activate = 1
\fP
.PP
.PP
Generate an RSA client key pair in a PKCS#11 token:
.PP
\fB
    p11sak generate\-key rsa 2048 \-\-label '<name-of-client-key>' \-\-slot <n>
\fP
.PP
If you want to generate an EC key instead, use:
.PP
\fB
    p11sak generate\-key EC <curve-name> \-\-label '<name-of-client-key>' \-\-slot <n>
\fP
.PP
Then export the private client key as a URI-PEM file. A URI-PEM file contains
a PKCS#11 URI referencing the key in the PKCS#11 token, but no key material.
By default, the PKCS#11 URI does not contain the PKCS#11 user PIN. Refer to the
man page of \fBp11sak\fP(1) and option \fB\-\-uri\-pem\fP for details about how
to include the PKCS#11 user PIN or a PIN source into the URI.
.PP
\fB
    p11sak export\-key \-\-label '<name-of-client.key>:prv' \-\-uri\-pem      \\
                       \-\-file '/path_to_client_key/client.key'          \\
                       \-\-slot <n>>
\fP
.PP
With that private client key as URI-PEM file you can create a self-signed
certificate using the following OpenSSL command:
.PP
\fB
    openssl req \-x509 \-key '/path_to_client_key/client.key'              \\
                \-out '/path_to_client_certificate/selfsigned_client.crt' \\
                \-nodes \-days 3650                                        \\
                \-subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US'
\fP
.PP
You are prompted for the PKCS#11 user PIN, unless the user PIN is contained in
the PKCS#11 URI. You are also prompted for further information for the
certificate to create, unless these details are supplied via the OpenSSL config
file. Refer to the man page of the \fBopenssl req\fP command for further
details.
.PP
If you want to generate a CA-signed certificate instead, omit the \fB\-x509\fP
option. Thus, the command generates a certificate signing request instead, that
you pass to the CA. With this request, you let the CA sign the certificate and
issue a CA-signed certificate for you.
.PP
Instead of using an URI-PEM file, you can also use the PKCS#11 URI directly. Use
the \fBp11sak list\-key\fP command with the \fB\-\-long\fP option to display
the PKCS#11 URI of the client private key object. Then specify this URI as-is
at the \fB\-key\fP option of the \fBopenssl req\fP command from above:
.PP
\fB
    openssl req \-x509 \-key 'pkcs11:....;type=private'                    \\
                \-out '/path_to_client_certificate/selfsigned_client.crt' \\
                \-nodes \-days 3650                                        \\
                \-subj '/CN=www.mydom.com/O=My Company Name LTD./C=US'
\fP
.PP
There is no need to export the client private key as URI-PEM file in this case.
.PP
.SS USING THE CLIENT KEY AND CERTIFICATE WITH P11KMIP
Use the private client key as URI-PEM (\fB'/path_to_client_key/client.key'\fP)
or as PKCS#11 URI (\fB'pkcs11:....;type=private'\fP) and the client certificate
(\fB'/path_to_client_certificate/selfsigned_client.crt'\fP)
with the \fBp11kmip\fP commands described below. You can specify the client key
and client certificate using options \fB\-\-kmip\-client\-key\fP and
\fB\-\-kmip\-client\-cert\fP, or in the \fB/etc/opencryptoki/p11kmip.conf\fP
configuration file, or via environment variables.
.PP
When using a URI-PEM file, or a password-protected PEM file as client key, then
you are prompted for the PKCS#11 user PIN or the PEM password when the
\fBp11kmip\fP tool reads the client key PEM file, unless the PEM password is
specified using the \fB\-\-pem\-password\fP option. The prompt looks like this:
.PP
\fB
    Please enter PEM password for '/path_to_client_key/client.key':
\fP
.PP
Note that the prompt message is the same when using a URI-PEM file, and it is
prompting for the PKCS#11 user PIN. For a URI-PEM file, the PEM password is the
PKCS#11 user PIN required to access the PKCS#11 token that contains the key
the URI is referring to.
.PP
If you specify a PKCS#11 URI directly as client private key, then you are
explicitely prompted for the PKCS#11 user PIN for the specified URI.

.RB [ \-\-gen\-targkey ]
.RB [ \-\-targkey\-length
.IR LENGTH ]
.RB [ OPTIONS ]
.PP
Use the
.BR import\-key
command to import a target key located on a KMIP server to a
PKCS\~#11 token repository. Importing a key from a KMIP server requires a wrapping key present on 
the server with its corresponding unwrapping key present in a local PKCS\#11 slot. 
Currently RSA is supported for wrapping and unwrapping keys and AES is supported for
target keys.

The
.BR \-\-targkey\-label | \-t
.I TARGKEY\-LABEL
option specifies the KMIP name attribute of the target key to be imported.
Once imported into the PKCS\~#11 token repository, the
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute of the target key will be set to the same value as
.IR TARGKEY\-LABEL .
The 
.BR \-\-wrapkey\-label | \-w
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL
option specifies the KMIP name attribute of the key to be used for wrapping.
This wrapping key must already be present on the KMIP server, unless the
.BR \-\-send\-wrapkey
option is specified.

The imported key will be unwrapped using a corresponding unwrapping key 
located in the PKCS\~#11 token repository with a
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute value that is the same as
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL
, unless the
.B \-\-unwrapkey\-label | \-u
.I UNWRAPKEY\-LABEL
option identifies a different private key instead.

When the
.BR \-\-send\-wrapkey
option is specified, the 
.BR \-\-wrapkey\-label | \-w
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL
option will instead be used to identify a public key 
located in the PKCS\~#11 token repository, with a 
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute value that is the same as specified by 
.IR WRAPKEY\-LABEL .
This public key is sent and registered on the KMIP server with a KMIP name
specified by 
.BR \-\-wrapkey\-label .
The public key will then be used for wrapping.

After the import operation has been completed successfully, information will be displayed
about the keys involved. This includes the 
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute values of the imported target key and wrapping key, the KMIP UID attributes
of both keys, and a SHA-256 digest of the imported target key from both the KMIP server and the
PKCS\~#11 token repository.

Example:
  Target Key
     PKCS#11 Label...TARGET_KEY_LABEL
     PKCS#11 Digest..FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
     KMIP UID........TARGET_KEY_UUID
     KMIP Digest.....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  Wrapping Key
     PKCS#11 Label...WRAPPING_KEY_LABEL
     KMIP UID........WRAPPING_KEY_UUID

The 
.B \-\-targkey\-attrs 
.I TARGKEY\-ATTRS 
option can be used to set the boolean attributes of the imported target key 
(see below for detailed description of the attributes). The
.B \-\-targkey\-id
.I ID 
option may be used to set the value of the 
.BR CKA_ID
attribute of the target key.

When the
.BR \-\-gen\-targkey
option is specified, the target key will first be generated on the
KMIP server. In this case, the value of the 
.BR \-\-targkey\-label | \-t
.I TARGKEY\-LABEL
option will be used as the KMIP name attribute of the generated key. 
Currently, only AES symmetric keys may be generated in this way.

The 
.B \-\-targkey\-length 
.I LENGTH 
option may be used to specify the length of the generated with the
.BR \-\-gen\-targkey
option, and is only valid when specified with that option. 
.I LENGTH 
must be one of 128, 192, or 256. The default is 256.

.RB [ OPTIONS ]
.PP
Use the
.BR export\-key
command to export a target key located in a PKCS\~#11 token
repository to a KMIP server. Exporting a key from a PKCS\~#11 slot to a KMIP server requires an 
unwrapping key to be present on the server with a corresponding wrapping key present in the 
PKCS\~#11 slot. Currently only RSA is supported for wrapping and unwrapping keys and 
AES for target keys.

The
.BR \-\-targkey\-label | \-t
.I TARGKEY\-LABEL
option specifies the 
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute value of the target key to be exported.
Once exported to the KMIP server, the KMIP name attribute of the 
target key will be set to the same value as
.IR TARGKEY\-LABEL .
The 
.BR \-\-wrapkey\-label | \-w
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL
option species the 
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute value of key to be used for wrapping the exported key. The wrapping
key must already be present in PKCS\~#11 token repository, unless the 
.BR \-\-retr\-wrapkey
option is specified.

The exported key will be unwrapped corresponding unwrapping key 
located on the KMIP server with a KMIP name attribute that is the same as
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL
.

When the
.BR \-\-retr\-wrapkey
option is specified, the 
.BR \-\-wrapkey\-label | \-w
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL
option will instead be used to identify a wrapping key 
located on the KMIP server with a KMIP name attribute that is the
same as 
.IR WRAPKEY\-LABEL .
This wrapping key will be retrieved from the KMIP server and imported into the
PKCS\~#11 token repository, with a 
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute value of
.I WRAPKEY\-LABEL 
, and used to wrap the exported key. When the wrapping key is being retrieved 
from the KMIP server, the
.B \-\-wrapkey\-attrs 
.I WRAPKEY\-ATTRS
option can be used to set the boolean attributes of the retrieved wrapping key 
(see below for detailed description of the attributes). The
.B \-\-wrapkey\-id
.I ID 
option may be used to set the value of the 
.BR CKA_ID
attribute of the public key.

After the export operation has been completed successfully, information will be displayed
about the keys involved. This includes the 
.B CKA_LABEL
attribute values of the exported target key and public key, the KMIP UID attributes
of both keys, and a SHA-256 digest of the exported target key from both the KMIP server and the
PKCS\~#11 token repository.

Example:
  Target Key
     PKCS#11 Label...TARGET_KEY_LABEL
     PKCS#11 Digest..FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
     KMIP UID........TARGET_KEY_UUID
     KMIP Digest.....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

For the
.B export\-key
command, specify the PKCS\~#11 boolean attributes that are to be set for the 
retrieved wrapping key. For the
.B import\-key
, specify the PKCS\~#11 boolean attributes that are to be set for the 
imported target key.
.PP
.RS 8
.B Note:
Not all boolean attributes are applicable to all key types and/or commands and
will be silently ignored if not applicable.
.PP
The respective attributes are set to
.B TRUE
when the corresponding letter is specified in uppercase, or
.B FALSE
when the corresponding letter is specified in lowercase.
Attributes (except \fBCKA_TOKEN\fP and \fBCKA_SENSITIVE\fP, see below) that are
not specified get the default value as defined by the PKCS\~#11 standard or the
used PKCS\~#11 token implementation when generating keys, or are not updated
when setting the attributes of an existing key.
.PP
Attribute
.B CKA_TOKEN
is always set to \fBTRUE\fP for imported symmetric keys, and is set to \fBTRUE\fP
by default for public keys. This is because session keys are not persistent, and
thus would no longer exist after the session that the
.B p11kmip
tool has opened is closed when it exists. For public keys only, this can be overridden by 
specifying the respective uppercase or lowercase letter for the CKA_TOKEN attribute in 
the attribute string, as desired.
.PP
When importing or recieving a key with the
.B p11kmip
tool, attribute
.B CKA_SENSITIVE
defaults to \fBTRUE\fP for symmetric keys. However, this can be overridden by 
specifying the respective uppercase or lowercase letter for the CKA_SENSITIVE
attribute in the attribute string, as desired.
.PP
.B Note:
The default setting for the
.B CKA_SENSITIVE
attribute is defined by the
.B p11kmip
tool, and might be different from the default setting that would be chosen by
the used PKCS\~#11 implementation.
.PP
The following letters are associated with the respective
.BR CK_ATTRIBUTE :
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B H
\- CKA_TOKEN
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B P
\- CKA_PRIVATE
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B M
\- CKA_MODIFIABLE
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B B
\- CKA_COPYABLE
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B Y
\- CKA_DESTROYABLE
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B S
\- CKA_SENSITIVE
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B X
\- CKA_EXTRACTABLE
.IP "\(bu" 2
.B K
\- CKA_IBM_PROTKEY_EXTRACTABLE (IBM specific, not all tokens support this)
.PP
For multiple attributes, specify a set of these letters without any blanks in
between, e. g. \fB'MlD'\fP. An uppercase letter means \fBTRUE\fP, while a
lowercase letter means \fBFALSE\fP.
From Example above, \fB'MbS'\fP corresponds to: \fBCKA_MODIFIABLE=TRUE,
CKA_COPYABLE=FALSE, CKA_SENSITIVE=TRUE\fP.
