.SH NAME
p11sak_defined_attrs.conf \- Configuration file for \fBp11sak list\-key\fP
command.
.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B p11sak
tool uses the configuration files \fB~/.p11sak_defined_attrs.conf\fP and
\fB/etc/opencryptoki/p11sak_defined_attrs.conf\fP to read information about
custom attributes that shall be printed with the \fBp11sak list\-key\fP command.
.PP
This configuration file path can be overwritten by the user with the environment
variable \fBP11SAK_DEFAULT_CONF_FILE\fP.
If the environment variable is not set, then
\fB.p11sak_defined_attrs.conf\fP is first tried to be read from the current
user's home directory. If this is not available, the global
\fB/etc/opencryptoki/p11sak_defined_attrs.conf\fP config file is read.
If none of these files are available, a warning message is displayed, and
printing of custom attributes is not available.
