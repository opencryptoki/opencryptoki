.TH STRENGTH.CONF 5 "September 2021" "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "openCryptoki"
.SH NAME
strength.conf \- Configuration file for openCryptoki strength configuration.

.SH DESCRIPTION
openCryptoki uses a strength configuration file at
/etc/opencryptoki/strength.conf

This configuration file allows users to configure openCryptoki
cryptographic key strength determination based on key attributes.
This file is required by openCryptoki.

.SH SYNTAX
This file starts with a version specification of the form
\fBversion strength-0\fR
followed by the definition of various strengths.

.P
Each strength definition is composed of a strength, brackets and key-value pairs.

 strength number
 {
     ...
 }

Supported numbers are 112, 128, 192, and 256 representing the
corresponding strength in bits.

Note: These definitions are optional.  If a definition is missing, no
key can have the strength.  If no strength definition is present, all
keys will have strength 0.

More than one key-value pair may be used within a strength description.

A key-value pair is composed of
.B keyword = value
where
.B value
is an unsigned number.

The following keywords are valid:

.TP
.BR MOD_EXP
Specifies the minimum number of bits required for RSA moduli, and DH
and DSA primes such that the corresponding key is of the currently
defined strength.

Note: This key-value pair is optional.  If not present, no RSA, DH, or
DSA key can have the currently defined strength.
.TP
.BR ECC
Specifies the minimum number of bits in the prime field of the
elliptic curve such that the corresponding key is of the currently
defined strength.

Note: This key-value pair is optional.  If not present, no EC key can
have the currently defined strength.
.TP
.BR SYMMETRIC
Specifies the minimum number of bits required for symmetric keys such
that the corresponding key is of the currently defined strength.

Note: This key-value pair is optional.  If not present, no symmetric
key can have the currently defined strength.
.TP
.BR digest
Specifies the minimum size in bits of digest outputs required by the
currently defined strength.

Note: This key-value pair is optional.  If not present, this strength
definition does not constrain the size of digests.
.TP
.BR signature
Specifies the minimum size in bits of signatures required by the
currently defined strength.

Note: This key-value pair is optional.  If not present, this strength
definition does not constrain the size of signatures.

.SH NOTES

The strength configuration file has to be owned by \fBroot:@pkcs_group@\fP,
have mode 0640, and be parsable.  Otherwise, openCryptoki will return
\fBCKR_FUNCTION_FAILED\fR on \fBC_Initialize\fR and log a
corresponding message to syslog detailing the reason why the strength
configuration could not be used.  In this case, fix the problem
described in syslog to be able to use openCryptoki again.

.PP
The pound sign ('#') is used to indicate a comment.  Both the comment
character and any text after it, up to the end of the line, are
ignored. The comment character can be used at the beginning of a line
(including before the file version specification), after a value, and
before and after the braces.
