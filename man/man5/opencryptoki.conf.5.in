.TH OPENCRYPTOKI.CONF 5 "September 2012" "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "openCryptoki"
.SH NAME
opencryptoki.conf \- Configuration file for pkcsslotd.

.SH DESCRIPTION
pkcsslotd uses a configuration file at /etc/opencryptoki/opencryptoki.conf

This is a text file that contains information used to configure
pkcs#11 slots. At startup, the pkcsslotd daemon parses this file to
determine which slots will be made available.

.SH SYNTAX
This file is made up of optional global definitions, and slot descriptions.

The following global definitions are valid:

.TP
.BR disable-event-support
If this keyword is specified the openCryptoki event support is disabled.

.TP
.BR statistics\~(off | on [ ,implicit ][ ,internal ] )
Enables or disables collection of statistics of mechanism usage. By default,
statistics collection is enabled. A value of \fB(off)\fP disables all statistics
collection. A value of \fB(on)\fP enables collection of mechanism usage.
The collected statistics can be displayed using the \fBpkcsstats\fP tool.

In addition to enabling statistics collection for mechanisms used by PKCS#11
applications, you can specify \fB(on,implicit)\fP to also enable collection
of implicit mechanism usage, where additional mechanisms are specified in
mechanism parameters. For example, RSA-PSS or RSA-OAEP allow to specify a hash
mechanism and a mask generation function (MGF) in the mechanism parameter.
ECDH allows to specify a key derivation function (KDF) in the mechanism
parameter.

You can additionally enable statistics collection of mechanisms internally used
by Opencryptoki by specifying \fB(on,internal)\fP. This additionally collects
usage statistics for crypto operations used internally for pin handling and
encryption of private token objects in the data store.

Implicit and internal statistics collection can also be combined:
\fB(on,implicit,internal)\fP

.P
Each slot description is composed of a slot number, brackets and key-value pairs.

 slot number
 {
     key = value
     ...
 }

More than one key-value pair may be used within a slot description.

A key-value pair is composed of,
.B keyword = value.

The following keywords are valid:

.TP
.BR description
A Description of the slot. PKCS#11v2.20 defined this as a 64-byte max
character-string.
.TP
.BR stdll
This keyword is used to define the name of the stdll or token library that
will be used for this slot. The stdll is an available token library in
opencryptoki.
.TP
.BR manufacturer
This keyword is used to name the ID of the slot manufacturer. PKCS#11v2.20
defines this as a 32 byte long string.
.TP
.BR hwversion
Version number of the slot's hardware, if any. The version number is composed
of a major version number (the integer portion of the version) and a
minor version number (the hundredths portion of the version).
For example, version 1.2, major = 1, minor = 2
.TP
.BR firmwareversion
Version number of the slot's firmware, if any. The version number is composed
of a major version number (the integer portion of the version) and a
minor version number (the hundredths portion of the version).
.TP
.BR confname
If the slot is associated with a token that has its own configuration file,
this option identifies the name of that configuration file.
For example, confname=ep11tok.conf
.TP
.BR tokname
If a token want to have its own token directory name that is different from the
default name, especially if multiple tokens of the same type are configured,
this option defines the name of the token individual directory.
For example, tokname=ep11tok01

Note: This key-value pair is optional: If only one token per token type is used,
you don't need that entry. In that case the default directory name is used.
.TP
.BR tokversion
Version number of the slot's token of the form <major>.<minor>.

.SH Notes
The pound sign ('#') is used to indicate a comment.
Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of the line,
are ignored. The comment character cannot be used inside the brackets of
slot descriptions, as this will cause a syntax error.
