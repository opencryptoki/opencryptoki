.TH POLICY.CONF 5 "September 2021" "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "openCryptoki"
.SH NAME
policy.conf \- Configuration file for openCryptoki policies.

.SH DESCRIPTION
openCryptoki uses a policy configuration file at
/etc/opencryptoki/policy.conf

This configuration file restricts the operations of openCryptoki to a
specific set of allowed operations.  The policy allows users to
restrict keys to a minimal cryptographic strength, restrict supported
elliptic curves, mechanisms, MGFs, KDFs, or PRFs.

.SH SYNTAX
This file starts with a version specification of the form
\fBversion policy-0\fR
followed by policy constraints.

.P

A policy constraint assigns a value to a configuration key.  The
syntax depends of the value of the key:

.TP
.BR strength

This key defines the minimal required strength for keys, and digest
and signature sizes.  It corresponds to the definition in
/etc/opencryptoki/strength.conf.  Valid values are 0, 112, 128, 192,
and 256.  The special value 0 allows every key and arbitrary size of
digests and signatures.  The format is a simple assignment:

strength = number

If other values are used, they are rounded up to the next supported
value.  Values greater than 256 are rounded down to 256.

.TP
.BR allowedmechs

This key specifies a list of mechanisms that are allowed by this
policy.  The list should contain a comma-separated list of
.BR CKM_
constants supported by openCryptoki. The list is placed inside
brackets:

allowedmechs ( mech1, mech2 )

Note: This key is optional.  If not present, all mechanisms are
allowed.  If an empty list is provided, no mechanism would be allowed.
.TP
.BR allowedcurves

This key specifies a list of allowed elliptic curves.  Keys that do
not belong to any of the allowed curves cannot be created or used.
The list has the same format as the
.BR allowedmechs
key:

allowedcurves ( curve1, curve2 )

Valid curve names are:

Note: This key is optional.  If not present, all curves are allowed.
An empty list allows no curve.
.TP
.BR allowedmgfs

This key specifies the allowed Message Generation Functions (MGFs) for
use in RSA OAEP and RSA PSS.  The value is a list of
.BR CKG_
constants supported by openCryptoki.  The list has the same format as
the
.BR allowedmechs
key:

allowedmgfs ( mgf1, mgf2 )

Note: This key is optional.  If not present, all MGFs are allowed.  An
empty list allows no MGF.
.TP
.BR allowedkdfs

This key specifies the allowed Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) for use
in ECDH key derivation and Kyber KEM.  The value is a list of
.BR CKD_
constants supported by openCryptoki.  This list has the same format as
the
.BR allowedmechs
key:

allowedkdfs ( kdf1, kdf2 )

Note: This key is optional.  If not present, all KDFs are allowed.  An
empty list allows no KDF.
.TP
.BR allowedprfs

This key specifies the allowed Pseudo-Random Functions (PRFs) for use
in PKCS #5 PBKDF.  The value is a list of PRFs.  Currently, the only
supported value is
.BR CKP_PKCS5_PBKD2_HMAC_SHA256
.BR CKP_PKCS5_PBKD2_HMAC_SHA512
which leads to the list

allowedprfs ( CKP_PKCS5_PBKD2_HMAC_SHA512, CKP_PKCS5_PBKD2_HMAC_SHA256 )

Note: This key is optional.  If not present, all PRFs are allowed.  An
empty list allows no PRF.

.SH NOTES

The policy configuration file has to be owned by \fBroot:pkcs11\fP and
have mode 0640.  Otherwise, openCryptoki will return
\fBCKR_FUNCTION_FAILED\fR on \fBC_Initialize\fR and log the reason
into syslog.

.PP

The pound sign ('#') is used to indicate a comment.  Both the comment
character and any text after it, up to the end of the line, are
ignored. The comment character can be used at the beginning of a line
(including before the file version specification), after the strength
value, after a comma, and before and after the bracket.

.PP
Since the policy indirectly refers to a strength configuration, a
strength configuration has to exist and be valid.  If no strength
configuration exists, no policy will be enforced.  If an existing
policy configuration is invalid, openCryptoki cannot be used.

.PP

openCryptoki uses some cryptographic operations to store token
objects.  These operations have to be allowed by the policy.  Which
operations are needed depends on the token store format and the token
(since the ICSF Token as a remote token uses different crypto
operations to store its management data):

.RS
.IP "FIPS compliant format"
Token stores in the FIPS compliant format need the mechanisms
.BR CKM_AES_KEY_GEN,
.BR CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP,
.BR CKM_AES_GCM,
.BR CKM_PKCS5_PBKD2,
the PRF
.BR CKP_PKCS5_PBKD2_HMAC_SHA512,
and must allow 256 bit AES keys.
.IP "legacy format"
Token stores in legacy format need the mechanisms
.BR CKM_DES3_KEY_GEN,
.BR CKM_DES3_CBC,
.BR CKM_AES_KEY_GEN,
.BR CKM_AES_CBC,
.BR CKM_SHA1,
.BR CKM_MD5
and must allow 2-key TDES keys (80 bit symmetric keys with 64 bit signatures).
.IP "ICSF Token store"
.BR CKM_AES_KEY_GEN,
.BR CKM_AES_CBC,
.BR CKM_SHA1,
.BR CKM_MD5
.BR CKM_PKCS5_PBKD2,
the PRF
.BR CKP_PKCS5_PBKD2_HMAC_SHA256,
and must allow 256 bit AES keys.
.RE

Tokens cannot be loaded if their token store format is not supported
by the policy.  If a token cannot be loaded, a message is printed into
syslog detailing the policy violation.  To fix this problem, make sure
the token format is allowed by your policy (either by satisfying above
constraints or by temporarily removing /etc/opencryptoki/policy.conf)
and migrate your token store, e.g., to the FIPS-compliant format.
