openCryptoki Test Programs

This directory contains programs designed to test the functionality of
openCryptoki and PKCS#11.  The rely on STDLL's installed to the standard system
location.  Many of the programs have command line options for passing the slot
number to use (default is slot 0) as well as other options.  All programs expect
that the a slot has been intialized using pkcsconf.  The expected user pin is
"01234567" and this can also be set using pkcsconf.  The expected PINs can also
be changed by modifying DEFAULT_USER_PIN and DEFAULT_SO_PIN in
include/regress.h.

For correct testcase execution, the token should be initialized before and
after running the testcases.
