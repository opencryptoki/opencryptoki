Notes:

aes_tests
	Tests aes cbc/ecb/ctr modes using published test vectors and
	generated test data.
	
	ICSF token - secret keys cannot wrap secret keys. 
	These testcase will fail in ICSF token. 

	CCA token -  uses secure key, the "-securekey" flag should be 
	used to ensure appropriate testcases are run.

des_tests
	Tests des ecb/cbc modes using published test vectors and generated
	test data.

	ICSF token - secret keys cannot wrap secret keys. 
	These testcase will fail in ICSF token. 

	CCA token -  uses secure key, the "-securekey" flag should be 
	used to ensure appropriate testcases are run.

des3_tests
	Tests des3 ecb/cbc modes using published test vectors and generated
	test data. 
	Tests des3 cbc mode with padding only using generated test data.

	ICSF token - secret keys cannot wrap secret keys. 
	These testcase will fail in ICSF token. 

	CCA token -  uses secure key, the "-securekey" flag should be 
	used to ensure appropriate testcases are run.

dh_tests
	Tests key generation and key derivation.

digest_tests
	Tests message digest, multipart message digest, and signature 
	verification using published test vectors for:
	SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, MD2, MD5, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-128
	HMAC SHA1, HMAC SHA256, HMAC SHA512, HMAC MD5

dsa_tests
	TODO - To be tested.

ec_tests
	Tests regular curves.

rsa_tests
	Tests RSA using published test vectors and generated test data. 

        ICSF token -  only supports public exponents 0x03 and 0x010001.
	Testcases with other exponents will fail.

ssl3_tests
	Tests key generation and key derivation.
